# About
This extension adds syntax highlighting for KRL (Kinetic Rule Language) to Visual Studio Code.

# Installation
I have not (yet) published this extension to the official Visual Studio Code Place for Extensions.  For now, the easiest way to install the extension is to clone this repository to your VS Code extensions folder.

    git clone https://github.com/krrg/krl-language-vscode.git ~/.vscode/extensions/krl-language-vscode
